# Next steps

## Create utility scripts for the rest of the operations

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A utility script that allows us to update existing tasks exists.
2. A utility script that allows us to delete existing tasks exists.

### Note
The methods (for the requests module) for issuing `PUT` or `DELETE` HTTP requests are:
1. `requests.put(URL, json=SOMEDATA)`
2. `requests.delete(URL)`
